# PGN-Filter

# About this PGN converter:
  **This PGN filter script works for any chess variant supported by the python-chess library, as it processes moves and legality based on the variantâ€™s rules automatically. Whether it's standard chess, Chess960, King of the Hill, Horde, Antichess or others, it will correctly handle the game data as long as the PGN is valid.**

```bash
pip install python-chess
```
# After Set up PGN
```bash
python whitefiltered.py
```
```bash
python blackfiltered.py
```
